# Rock paper scissors

This is a project for the Odin Project to create a rock paper scissors game with a simple UI.

# Instructions

Click one of the three buttons (labeled rock, paper, or scissors) to make your respective guess. Once clicked, the computer will also make its own guess. The guesses are compared, the round winner is announced, and the score is calculated. Sometimes a round is a tie, in which case the score won't change!

The game ends when either you or the computer first reaches 5 points and is announced as the winner. A button then appears prompting you to play again.
